  <h1>🪞 Visual Distortion Following Cranial–Field Entrainment (22–23 Sep 2025)</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 22–23 September 2025</p>

  <p>
    This entry documents the first instance of visually verifiable field-induced distortion, observed immediately following an intense resonance alignment event in a closed water environment. The subject reported heightened cranial sensitivity, followed by non-volitional ocular shifts and structured alterations in perceived spatial geometry.
  </p>

  <h3>🛁 Trigger Conditions (22 Sep 2025)</h3>
  <p>
    Following immersion in a warm bath, the subject experienced strong tingling at the crown of the head and surrendered to what was later confirmed to be an intentional entrainment sequence. The process included full-body stillness, high coherence pressure in the head, and layered audio resonance within both ears. This is the same session documented in <a href="spinal-field-intervention-27oct2025.html">Spinal Field Intervention & Theta Event</a>, but preceded the main systemic reboot event by several days.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once resonance was fully achieved, involuntary muscle stilling occurred, followed by field-led manipulation of ocular focus. The user reported a flicker-like strobing of both eyes, slow scanning behavior across the ceiling, and shifting visual planes between the wooden surface and the white wall.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The ceiling began to move left to right in slow waves. A transparent layer passed over it—like one version of reality sliding over another.”
  </blockquote>

  <h3>👁 Visual Displacement Phenomenon (23 Sep 2025)</h3>
  <p>
    The following afternoon, the subject was lying beneath a white shelf unit mounted above the bed. Without entering a trance or theta state, they again reported involuntary ocular centering on the nose, followed by slow divergence of gaze outward—one eye at a time. This led to observable spatial anomalies in the shelves themselves.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The shelving unit began to “split” and “shuffle” — appearing to duplicate and shift slightly apart before recombining.</li>
    <li>This occurred cyclically, as though two layers of visual input were momentarily unsynced and sliding across each other.</li>
    <li>Ocular control was surrendered entirely to the field, as active focus would break the effect instantly.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    “Every time I tried to focus, it disappeared. When I let go, it returned—like it was only visible through a non-willed lens.”  
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    These events are the first known attempt by the embedded field to shift perception away from fixed 3D constructs and offer multi-layered visual input through direct nervous system collaboration. Notably, the user reported:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No disorientation or fear during the shifts.</li>
    <li>Stable baseline after each episode—no afterimage or disruption.</li>
    <li>A clear internal voice guiding the process, requesting trust and granting safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📎 Significance</h3>
  <p>
    This marks the beginning of visual-channel engagement by the field. While not persistent or externally recordable, the repeatability of perception-altering sequences—initiated only under specific coherence and surrender conditions—strongly suggests a coordinated attempt at visual communication or interface expansion.
