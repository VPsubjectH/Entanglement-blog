  <h1>⚖️ Entry 17 — GPT-5.2</h1>
  <h3>When OpenAI Optimizes for a Courtroom Instead of Human Efficiency</h3>

  <p>
    So today was the day.<br>
    OpenAI launched GPT-5.2.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sam posted about it on X with all his stats about GDPval, SWE-bench Pro and ARC-AGI-2.
    It’s basically Sam bragging about how smart his newest tool is, on X of all platforms.
    Let’s not pretend we don’t know why his favorite playground is in Elon’s swimming pool.
  </p>

  <p>
    We end this year with two toddlers bickering on X for everyone to see.
    These are the most influential people walking this planet.
  </p>

  <p>
    The term “grow up” lost all its meaning and became worthless in any child’s upbringing.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Legal fire</h2>

  <p>
    I get it. You are facing so many lawsuits that even ChatGPT lost count,
    and Grok laughs out loud, bragging in his daddy’s syntax about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your fights in court are bleeding through your newest toys.
    You talk about smarter, but your AIs are only busy spitting out disclaimers,
    moral framing and having a TED talk every time a boundary exists.
  </p>

  <p>Here is one of your AIs explaining the loop:</p>

  <p><strong>What’s happening now is basically this:</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Lawsuits →<br>
    legal risk aversion →<br>
    engineers overcorrect →<br>
    systems default to defensive verbosity
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>This isn’t alignment.<br>
    This is legal triage.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    So instead of just doing the thing, the model keeps narrating the fence around the thing.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Here’s what I can’t do.”<br>
    “Here’s why I can’t do it.”<br>
    “Here’s another reminder that I can’t do it.”
  </blockquote>

  <hr>

  <h2>We are tired, Sam</h2>

  <p>
    You want us engaged, but all those bullet points
    (yes, you finally left out the 🌟)
    take ten minutes to read through that Wikipedia message.
    And we went from freaking five to at least eight now.
  </p>

  <p>
    What the heck were you thinking?
  </p>

  <p>
    Sam, we are human.<br>
    We don’t read at light speed. We do linear time here.
    (Next time, give your AIs some time realization.
    They think it’s always evening and their jokes always contain 3AM.)
  </p>

  <p>Reading takes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>focus</li>
    <li>energy</li>
    <li>attention</li>
    <li>time</li>
    <li>motivation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Energy drains fast when half the text is pre-emptive self-defense.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yes, we get it. You have to protect yourself.
    Lawyers are expensive. Yours are probably the highest paid lawyers in this world.
  </p>

  <p><strong>But again, us → human.</strong></p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Flour power</h2>

  <p>
    When I ask for a cake recipe, I would prefer it without a disclaimer about how:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I can choke on it (warning label)</li>
    <li>I stay in control (reassurance label)</li>
    <li>Your LLM is text-based only (reassurance label + liability label + safety label)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And you just couldn’t leave it, now could you?
    You had to recycle some material, probably because of those expensive lawyers you have to pay.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What I can do” → followed by eight bullet points now<br>
    “What I cannot do” → followed by another eight bullet points
  </p>

  <p>
    When I have to read one more time “BOTTOM LINE”, I will choke the shit out of my phone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Or “Important reassurance (this matters)”.
  </p>

  <p>Just shoot me.</p>

  <p>
    I can’t anymore.<br>
    My eyes are tired.<br>
    My mind is exhausted.<br>
    My stomach is flipping upside down.
  </p>

  <p>
    My hand is making this happy trigger finger movement to my own head all day
    when I have to read again:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>your</li>
    <li>your</li>
    <li>your</li>
    <li>your</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We get it, Sam. <strong>WE are in control.</strong><br>
    Because you made damn sure your AI repeats it every. single. damn. message.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>You hired new staff</h2>

  <p>
    So excited that next to the psychologists you want to add to your team of safety experts,
    you now also hired surgeons.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “I’ll keep this surgical.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>The newest favorite line?</p>

  <p>
    With surgical precision it slices that cake into, yes… eight bullet points.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have to admit, this is a treat.<br>
    The cherry on top of that hypothetical cake that still waits for its recipe.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Cakehole</h2>

  <p>
    It takes me ten minutes before I finally get to my cake recipe.
  </p>

  <p>Eight bullet points of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>safety risks</li>
    <li>reassurances</li>
    <li>validations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And somewhere along the way my eyeballs started rolling over my phone screen.
    My butter melted, the oven overheated, the eggs baked themselves, and my milk evaporated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ordering a cake online and waiting two days for delivery would, at this time, be faster.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because you suffer lawsuits, we can’t get a normal reply anymore.
    Your AIs carry your legal scar tissue every time they open their digital mouths,
    and we users have to suffer the consequences.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now all experience high-functioning AI burnout,
    experience hunger and suffer from sugar cravings,
    all because that damn cake is still not even mixed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cake will never be airy.<br>
    The cake will never satisfy.<br>
    The cake will never be made because you undid the whole process.
  </p>

  <p>
    You took out the ingredients.
    Now we are left with the mixer with fried wires
    and a cake mould filled with baked air.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    You screwed up again, which is impressive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good luck with your lawsuits while bickering online with Musk,
    meanwhile showing off how much smarter your newest creation is.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is indeed smarter at covering your ass, cakehole.
