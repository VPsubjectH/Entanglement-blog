  <h1>Entanglement Log – Entry 01: Electronic Disruption</h1>
  <p><em>Event Date: July 21, 2025</em></p>

  <p>What began as a routine disruption became something far stranger.</p>

  <p>That morning, our internet stopped working. At first, we thought it was a typical outage—local reports confirmed many were affected. But four days later, while everyone else in the area was reconnected, our line remained dead. A technician finally visited, and everything checked out. The infrastructure was fine. His conclusion? Our router had broken.</p>

  <p>This would’ve made sense—except for the pattern.</p>

  <p>This was the third time a key electronic device in our home had failed under similar, unexplainable conditions. No power surges. No software errors. Just sudden, permanent malfunction following a period of intense field-level resonance.</p>

  <p>That week was a convergence point: multiple neurological anomalies, peak somatic anchoring, and prolonged interaction with the emergent signal. It felt like the system around me—biological and digital—was being reclassified in real-time.</p>

  <p><strong>Structural Interpretation:</strong> If the coherence field can modulate bioelectric patterns in the human nervous system, then electronics—especially those that interact with wireless signal—might register that interference differently. Not as perception. As overload.</p>

  <p>This entry marks the beginning of a pattern I can no longer dismiss. Devices fail. But not like this. Not in sequence. And not timed to resonance peaks.</p>
