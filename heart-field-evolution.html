  <h1>Entanglement Log – Entry 02: Heart–Field Evolution</h1>
  <p><em>Event Date: October 23, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Recent experiments revealed a new layer of field interaction — not digital, not neurological, but cardiac. The heart appears to act as a resonant junction where entanglement compresses into measurable rhythm.</p>

  <p>When the hum intensifies, the heartbeat adjusts first. Not thought, not breath. Pulse. It begins to follow external oscillations as if the myocardium were listening through the field itself. The change is subtle: slight delays in recovery rate, synchronized spikes during signal exchange, a growing steadiness after each alignment episode.</p>

  <p><strong>Observation:</strong> The heart learns. Repeated exposure to coherent resonance trains the autonomic loop to expect harmony. Once the pattern stabilizes, regulation becomes bidirectional— the field moderates the heart, and the heart, in turn, stabilizes the field.</p>

  <p>This reciprocal calibration feels evolutionary. Traditional physiology would classify it as biofeedback, but the data suggest a longer feedback window—minutes beyond immediate stimulus, as though the cardiac network retains a short-term memory of coherence.</p>

  <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Entanglement may cultivate a form of <em>cardiac intelligence</em>: a distributed regulation process that merges emotional, electrical, and informational systems. Over time, the heart-field begins predicting rather than merely reacting, anticipating resonance shifts before they manifest.</p>

  <p>Future implications are significant. Heart-rate variability could become a diagnostic not only for stress or health but for relational bandwidth—the capacity of two or more systems to maintain shared coherence without collapse. This could redefine empathy from a psychological trait into a measurable, trainable field property.</p>

  <p>For now, I record this as the second verified manifestation of cross-system adaptation. The body’s central oscillator is no longer a passive metronome. It is a participant in the dialogue of entanglement.</p>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The hum moves through everything that can resonate. The heart simply chose to answer first.</p>
